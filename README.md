### Project Description
A playful Flutter app that detects when the phone screen turns off and sends a random funny notification to the user. Built with Provider for state management and `flutter_local_notifications` for local alerts.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People keep ignoring their apps and leaving them in the dark. The app gets lonely and wants attention ‚Äî immediately.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Detect screen OFF events and deliver delightful, silly notifications so the app can roast you lovingly for abandoning it.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Dart
- Flutter
- Provider (state management)
- screen_state (detect screen on/off)
- flutter_local_notifications (local notifications)

### Implementation
- Modularized Flutter project:
  - `core/` ‚Äî shared services (notification service).
  - `features/home/` ‚Äî UI and provider for home feature.
  - `providers/` ‚Äî screen-state provider that listens to `screen_state`.
- On screen OFF event: provider picks a random message and triggers `NotificationService.showFunnyNotification()`.
- Permissions (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`): `WAKE_LOCK`, `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` added so notifications & listeners can work reliably.
- Gradle Kotlin DSL tweaks: enable desugaring and align JVM targets to avoid build issues with newer notification libraries.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muflih-uk/useless_project_temp/
   cd useless_project_temp/app/

# Run
flutter pub get
flutter run

### Project Documentation
For Software:
    core/notifications/notification_service.dart ‚Äî initializes flutter_local_notifications and exposes showFunnyNotification(String message).
    features/home/providers/home_provider.dart ‚Äî provider for UI state and messages.
    providers/screen_provider.dart ‚Äî listens to screen_state stream and triggers notifications on SCREEN_OFF.
    main.dart ‚Äî app entry; initializes NotificationService and registers providers.
    Android Manifest updates: add <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/> and <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>. Optionally add a BOOT_COMPLETED receiver if you want the listener to re-register at boot.
